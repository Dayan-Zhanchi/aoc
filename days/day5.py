"""Cancer solution, but worked with intervals as tuples instead of ranges (as lists) as the latter sounded infeasible 
in python given the input, so had to watch out for alot of off-by-one error mistakes. The approach I went with was to 
apply the intervals in the form (start, range) to each mapping in the same way as in p1, but now instead I had to 
make sure that everytime an interval overlapped with a given entry in the map, a new interval was created (for the 
next mapping) according to the rules in p1 (but adapted to an interval). If the interval only partially overlapped, 
then the other part was sliced and iterated through to make a new interval for the next mapping. To not have to make 
two sliced intervals I sorted the map entries according to source, so there could only ever be one sliced interval 
each iteration (easier to see why by drawing examples), under assumption that there aren't any holes between the 
sources (which seemed to be the case when I checked)"""
